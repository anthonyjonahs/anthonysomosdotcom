# My Personal Website
This app is my personal website. It is a Node/Express app using Pug to render pages.

I took the opportunity to mess around with Bootstrap 4 which is still in alpha release.

The site is deployed with Heroku and I used a third-party DNS service to route traffic from a custom domain.
